Project Description

The IoT-Based Smart Connectivity System is designed to demonstrate how smart devices communicate over the internet using ISP infrastructure, modem connectivity, and 3G/4G mobile networks. This project is implemented and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer, which helps visualize real-world networking concepts.

The system enables IoT devices and client systems to connect to the internet through an ISP network using modems and wireless communication, allowing remote monitoring and control of devices.

Objectives

To understand how IoT devices connect to the internet using ISP services

To simulate real-time data transmission using 3G/4G networks

To study the role of modems, routers, and servers

To demonstrate smart connectivity using Cisco Packet Tracer

System Components

IoT Devices

Sensors (temperature, motion, smart appliances)

Smart devices connected to the network

Client System

Laptop or PC used to monitor or control IoT devices

Accesses data via web or cloud server

Modem

Connects the local network to the ISP

Converts digital signals to analog and vice versa

ISP (Internet Service Provider)

Provides internet connectivity

Routes data between client and IoT devices

3G/4G Network

Enables wireless communication

Allows remote access from mobile devices

Cisco Packet Tracer

Used for simulation and network configuration

Displays packet flow and connectivity

Working Principle

IoT devices collect data (temperature, motion, etc.).

Data is sent to the modem through a local network.

The modem connects to the ISP using a 3G/4G network.

ISP routes data to cloud or client system.

User accesses the data remotely using a PC or mobile device.

Commands can be sent back to control IoT devices.
